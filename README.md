Beginning of the game: a player received two sets of identical cards in random order on a table.
With the first card lift, a timer starts ticking, and a player’s error score is set to 0.
Game round: Each round the player lifts two cards from the table. If both cards match - the
cards disappear from the table. If the cards are different the player’s error score increases by 1.
The player continues to guess card matches until the table is clear.
End of the game: The player is rated by the time elapsed from the beginning of the game and
the error score.
